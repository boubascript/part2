# part2
Lab 08 part 2

1. bad-code.cpp had headers that weren't given in the lab. - Removed the headers and copied over correct file content from github.
2. Lack of comments documenting what parts of code did.
3. In main.cpp, did not intialize numtabs, given it a random value in memory, causing the for loop that adds tabs to go on forever.
4. Extra files in folder from doctests not needed, cleaned up makefile to reflect that.
5. Good style and variable naming.
